if you wish to write your own shaders please use the convert.sh over there

just make sure to run

macos:{
    run:  brew install glslang
    run:  brew install spirv-cross
}

linux:{
    run:  sudo apt install glslang-tools
    run:  sudo apt install spirv-cross
}

windows:{
    go to https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home
    install sdk
    add sdk to path
    go to https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross
    add binary to path
}

if you do decide to convert remember to code in glsl version 450

if you don't then you are evil )):<<<

just know that the format is a little like this:

input + output:

layout(location = 0) out vec4 gl_fragoutorsomething;     instead of: out vec4 gl_fragoutorsomething;

layout(location = 0) in vec3 a;     instead of: in vec3 a;
layout(location = 1) in vec2 b;     instead of: in vec2 b;

uniforms (textures):

layout(set = 0, binding = 0) uniform sampler2D tex;     instead of: uniform sampler2D tex;

uniforms (floats and stuff):

layout(set = 0, binding = 1) uniform abcd {     instead of: uniform float sheenStrength;
    float sheenStrength;                                    uniform vec3 sheenColor;
    vec3 sheenColor;
};

the rest is just standard glsl 330 core
